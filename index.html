        <h2 class="heading">Awa Dance Festival</h2>

        <div class="text">
          <p>
            The Awa Dance Festival (阿波踊り, Awa Odori) is held from 12 to 15
            August as part of the Obon festival in Tokushima Prefecture on
            Shikoku in Japan. Awa Odori is the largest dance festival in Japan,
            attracting over 1.3 million tourists every year.[1] Groups of
            choreographed dancers and musicians known as ren (連) dance through
            the streets, typically accompanied by the shamisen lute, taiko
            drums, shinobue flute and the kane bell. Performers wear traditional
            obon dance costumes, and chant and sing as they parade through the
            streets. Awa is the old feudal administration name for Tokushima
            Prefecture, and odori means "dance".

            Comic Market (Japanese: コミックマーケット, Hepburn: Komikku
            Māketto), more commonly known as Comiket (コミケット, Komiketto) or
            Comike (コミケ, Komike), is a semiannual doujinshi convention in
            Tokyo, Japan. A grassroots market focused on the sale of doujin
            (self-published) works, Comiket is a not-for-profit fan convention
            administered by the volunteer-run Comic Market Preparatory Committee
            (ComiketPC). Inaugurated on 21 December 1975 with an estimated 700
            attendees, Comiket has since grown to become the largest fan
            convention in the world, with an estimated turnstile attendance of
            750,000 in 2019. Comiket is typically held at Tokyo Big Sight in
            August and December, with the two events distinguished as Summer
            Comic Market (夏コミ, Natsukomi) and Winter Comic Market (冬コミ,
            Fuyukomi), respectively.

        <h2 class="heading">Hanami</h2>

        <div class="text">
          <p>
          Hanami (花見, "flower viewing") is the Japanese traditional custom of enjoying the transient beauty of flowers; flowers (花, hana) in this case almost always refer to those of the cherry (桜, sakura) or, less frequently, plum (梅, ume) trees.[1] From the end of March to early May, cherry trees bloom all over Japan,[2] and around the first of February on the island of Okinawa.[3] The blossom forecast (桜前線, sakura-zensen) "cherry blossom front" is announced each year by the Japan Meteorological Agency, and is watched carefully by those planning hanami as the blossoms only last a week or two.
          In modern-day Japan, hanami mostly consists of having an outdoor party beneath the sakura during daytime or at night. In some contexts the Sino-Japanese term kan'ō (観桜, view-cherry) is used instead, particularly for festivals. Hanami at night is called yozakura (夜桜) "night sakura". In many places such as Ueno Park temporary paper lanterns are hung for the purpose of yozakura. On the island of Okinawa, decorative electric lanterns are hung in the trees for evening enjoyment, such as on the trees ascending Mt. Yae, near Motobu Town, or at the Nakijin Castle.
          A more ancient form of hanami also exists in Japan, which is enjoying the plum blossoms instead, which is narrowly referred to as umemi (梅見, plum-viewing). This kind of hanami is popular among older people, because they are calmer than the sakura parties, which usually involve younger people and can sometimes be very crowded and noisy.
